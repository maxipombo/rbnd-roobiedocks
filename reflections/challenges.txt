I’m finishing my university degree on business but before that I used to study computer science so I feel like I have the basics but I’m not so confident to make programming as my career. On the other hand, I feel that I like programming more than finance, marketing, logistics and the other careers that I could follow after my graduation. What opportunities do I have to change my direction at the age of 22? Would I be able to do the change quickly? How many years does it take to be a senior developer?
