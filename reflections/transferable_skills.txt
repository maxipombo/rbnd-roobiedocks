On June 2016 I will finish my business administration degree in the University of Montevideo (Uruguay). I’m also a Computer Technical Assistant for the Universidad del Trabajo del Uruguay so I know a little about programming on C, php, css. I have a small web and graphic design company that work with CMS (Joomla, Wordpress, Magento) and Adobe Creative Suite.

I think my computer science background will help me overcome the initial challenges that might come along as a Ruby developer.

Besides from being a student, I’m a member of the staff of the University, I coordinate the volunteers organization, my job is coordinate all the leaders of the different areas (communications, internal/external projects, and alliances with others organizations).

At my job in the University I’m always trying to find new processes and new ways to work with the organization so I think my innovative spirit will help me solve problems programming. 

My mother tongue is Spanish, so my English isn’t 100% perfect. Sorry for that but I’m still learning.
